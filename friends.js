//This is the section where it will hold my data as sets of objects. The function below is just a example in an effort to save time.

    "name":"Ahmed",
    "photo":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/6/005/064/1bd/3435aa3.jpg",
    "scores":[
        5,
        1,
        4,
        4,
        5,
        1,
        2,
        5,
        4,
        1
      ]
  }

  // The next step would be to convert users information into an array of numbers. 
  // After the array of numbers is completed it will then compare the scores to the others users array to determine the "totalDifference".
  // Once the function has found its "friend" or "match" it will then display those results in a modal or pop up.
  // Once this is all functioning properly this will be hosted on Heroku.
